    <p class="paragraph">An academic calendar lets teachers input important 
        events and dates, which students can then view. 
        This ensures that students stay informed about upcoming exams, 
        assignments, and other significant academic activities. 
        It's a convenient tool for organizing schedules and keeping everyone on track with their studies</p>
